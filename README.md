# 🌍 TempestView 

Welcome to the **TempestView**, a comprehensive and interactive Tableau dashboard designed to uncover deep insights into global weather patterns and air quality conditions. Built with a data storytelling approach, this project showcases how raw data can be transformed into dynamic visuals that drive understanding and decision-making.

## 📌 Project Overview

This dashboard provides a real-time visual narrative of key climate variables across different countries, including:
- 🌡️ Average Temperature Distribution
- 💧 Humidity Levels per Country
- 🌈 Most Common Weather Conditions
- 🧪 Ozone (Air Quality) Levels
- 📍 Interactive Country-wise Filters

The goal is simple: **to make complex weather data intuitive, visual, and decision-friendly.**

## 🧹 Data Cleaning Process

Before diving into visualization, raw weather data underwent a detailed cleaning process in **Microsoft Excel**, which included:
- Removing duplicates and inconsistencies  
- Handling missing or null values  
- Standardizing entries for accuracy  
- Preparing datasets for Tableau compatibility

Clean data = meaningful insights.
